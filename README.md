# TWAIN dotnet library

NOTE: This is a rewrite test that internally uses parts of
[twaincs](https://github.com/twain/twain-cs) from
the TWAIN Working Group. It doesn't fully work yet.
Use V3 branch for the current version.

## Info

This is a dotnet library created to make working with 
[TWAIN](http://twain.org/) devices easier in dotnet. 
V4 of this lib has these goals:

* Targets latest TWAIN version (2.5).
* Supports full framework and netcore apps (if the framework is still supported).

## Using the lib

Before using this lib, you are recommended to become reasonably 
familiar with the TWAIN spec and understand how it works in general. 
The TWAIN spec can be downloaded from [twain.org](http://twain.org/).
