# TWAIN dotnet library

NOTE: This is V4 DEV and doesn't fully work yet.
Use V3 branch for working version.

## Info

This is a dotnet library created to make working with 
[TWAIN](http://twain.org/) easier. 
V4 of this lib has these goals:

* Targets latest TWAIN version (2.4 as of this writing).
* Supports all the TWAIN functions in the spec (directly or through dotnet wrapper).
* Works with both 32 or 64 bit data sources, under 32 or 64 bit apps.
* Supports dotnet 4+ and netcore 2+ apps.

## Using the lib

Before using this lib, you are recommended to become reasonably 
familiar with the TWAIN spec and understand how it works in general. 
The TWAIN spec can be downloaded from [twain.org](http://twain.org/).
