# TWAIN dotnet library

NOTE: This is a rewrite test that doesn't fully work yet.
Use V3 branch for the current version.

## Info

This is a dotnet library created to make working with 
[TWAIN](http://twain.org/) devices easier in dotnet. 
It internally uses some parts of the
[twaincs](https://github.com/twain/twain-cs) code from
the TWAIN Working Group.
V4 of this lib has these features:

* Targets latest TWAIN version (2.5).
* Runs under full framework (4.6.2+) and netcore variants (6.0+).

## Using the lib

Before using this lib, you are required to be reasonably 
familiar with the TWAIN spec and understand how it works in general. 
The TWAIN spec can be downloaded from [twain.org](http://twain.org/).
