This is a library created to make working with 
[TWAIN](http://twain.org/) easier in dotnet. 
V4 of this lib has these goals:

* Targets latest TWAIN version (2.4 as of this writing)
* Supports all the TWAIN functions in the spec (directly or through dotnet wrapper)
* Works with both 32 or 64 bit data sources, from 32 or 64 bit apps.
* Works on non-Windows platforms using dotnet core

## Using the lib

Before using this lib, you are recommended to become reasonably 
familiar with the TWAIN spec and understand how it works in general. 
The TWAIN spec can be downloaded from [twain.org](http://twain.org/).
