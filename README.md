# TWAIN Application-Library

## Info

This is a library created to make working with 
[TWAIN](http://twain.org/) easier in dotnet. 
This project has these goals:

* Targets latest TWAIN version (2.4 as of this writing)
* Supports all the TWAIN functions in the spec
* Works with both 32 and 64 bit data sources
* Works on non-Windows platforms using dotnet core or mono (maybe)

## Using the lib

Before using this lib, you are recommended to become reasonably 
familiar with the TWAIN spec and understand how it works in general. 
The TWAIN spec can be downloaded from [twain.org](http://twain.org/).
